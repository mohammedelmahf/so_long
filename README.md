This is a small game project from 1337/42school implemented using MiniLibX. The project is inspired by Game Freak's Pokemon Firered.

## Goals
This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites. And some very basic gameplay elements.

## Getting Started

```
### Install
